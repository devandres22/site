## How would you describe _Forage Analytics_ to someone who has never heard of it?

Forage is a mobile analytics product built from the ground up for React Native. We give development teams powerful insight into all mobile app user interactions. Forage captures and stores limitless data and delivers responsive analysis, removing the constraints faced with other tools.

## How does _Forage Analytics_ work?

Forage provides an SDK distributed through NPM. This allows you to integrate the SDK into your application and begin learning session activities and behaviours about your users. Forage SDK allows you to send custom screen and data events of any size with no limit on the amount of information you can send us. When the user minimises your application, Forage SDK bundles all the collected information you have requested and sends it to our scalable AWS backend for instant access to your data on app.forage-analytics.com.

## How does _Forage Analytics_ differ from other solutions?

Forage is the first purpose-built product made specifically for React Native. As a software company, our dev teams were constantly faced with project delays due to the limitations of other mobile analytics tools we used. With Forage we now capture and store unlimited data without being obstructed by daily limitations to what we can process.

## Why did you develop _Forage Analytics_?

Forage was built after continuous frustration with the current market offering. Using the industryâ€™s leading mobile application analytics tools our developers were faced with daily limitations to the amount of data we could capture and store. The mobile analytics market lacked a limitless, simple and intuitive solution which offered all of the most important features the big players do, for a fraction of the cost.

## What next?

We are looking to continually develop Forage and aim to make it a market leader within the mobile analytics space, continually taking on user feedback and testing new ways to help our end users.

## What does the future look like for _Forage Analytics_ and mobile development in general? Can you see any particular trends?

We have been listening to our users and are currently working on a technical overview screen of all your devices broken down in an easy-to-use dashboard, as well as user funnels. This will allow Product Owners / Project Managers to define their own flows within their application, and track the user dropout rate over any time period specified.

## What advice would you give to programmers getting into mobile development?

### Find out where you learn best and learn as much as possible

Videos, books, audio books and podcasts to name a few, there are many ways to learn, discover your preference and own it.

### Embrace a struggle to solve a problem, but not too much.

Struggling to solve a problem is natural, embrace the frustration often as it only makes finding the solution only that sweeter. However, there comes a point where you should seek the help from another person or a resource.

### Learn as much from others as possible

Two heads are better than one. If the primary developer encounters a problem, there will be two of you to solve the issue. You'll make fewer mistakes and it's an effective way to share knowledge.

### Pass your knowledge on. Teach others what you learn.

The software development community is collaborative, it strives to help one another. There will be many communities online you can participate in to help others and we'd urge you to join one. Teaching others what you know enables you to further your knowledge into that subject. Volunteer to hold a talk about a topic that piques your interest, it will force you to research the areas you never thought about to ensure you know the topic front and back. You'll be sharing your knowledge while furthering your own understanding.

## Who should I interview next?

We would recommend interviewing [Shrey Vijayvargiya](https://twitter.com/treyvijay) he's a lovely guy who has recently just received a demo from ourselves at Forage. Shrey is a Developer by profession with 2 years of working experience, and a Designer by interest.
